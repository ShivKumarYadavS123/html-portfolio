<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm Shiv Kumar Yadav S, a passionate learner currently diving deep into the world of web development.<br/>
   I enjoy exploring how the web works and creating interactive, user-friendly websites.<br/>
    This journey has been both challenging and rewarding, as I get to blend creativity with technical skills to build something meaningful.<br/>
  </p>

<p>
  Alongside my web development journey, I have a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms, which I recently mastered through a dedicated course. <br/>
  My knowledge in DSA helps me write efficient, optimized code, whether it's for solving complex problems or enhancing the performance of my applications.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  My expertise in programming extends to C and C++, where I have honed my skills over time.<br/>
   I take pride in writing clean, structured code and tackling problems with a logical approach<br/>.
   Combining my proficiency in these languages with my growing web development skills, I'm excited to build innovative solutions and grow as a developer.<br/>
